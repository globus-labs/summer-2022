# Summer 2022 Student Repo
This repository is for our summer students to create a page about themselves and what they've worked on this summer.

## Getting started
1. [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Create a branch to work on (and switch onto it)
3. Open `students/template.html` in your code editor (it may open automatically in your browser at first, so just specify your text editor when opening)
4. Save As `your-name.html` in the `students` directory
5. Fill in `your-name.html` with a small bio, along with your interests and goals for the summer. Use Bootstrap to style your page. See if you can add some [components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/accordion/) that make sense and look good! Try your best not to use any custom CSS.

** You will be editing your page throughout the summer with what you're working on, so feel free to use this first draft as an opportunity to learn Bootstrap and play around with different components. It's okay if this first draft looks a little silly!

## Tech we're using
We're using html and CSS for this website. We're also using the CSS framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/).
Bootstrap is an open-source CSS framework used for responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It provides HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other UI components. It's super useful to be familiar with how to use it. You can apply this to your personal or school projects to give them a professional looking UI.

To use Bootstrap effectively, you'll need to understand 2 key components:
- [Grid structure](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/)
- Styling using classes (such as [text color](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/colors/) and [margin and padding](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/))

[This article](https://www.toptal.com/front-end/what-is-bootstrap-a-short-tutorial-on-the-what-why-and-how) is a nice overview of Bootstrap. It's a few years old though, so the code may be a bit dated. It's still nice for the overall concept!

## How to contribute
We follow a [Pull Request workflow](https://medium.com/@urna.hybesis/pull-request-workflow-with-git-6-steps-guide-3858e30b5fa4), which is commonly used in open source projects as well as in industry. To contribute to this repo, follow these steps:

1. `git pull` the latest code to your machine.
2. `git checkout -b branch-name` to create a branch (filling in `branch-name` with the name of your branch) where you'll be making changes.
3. `git commit` and `git push` your code to this branch.
4. When you have changes you'd like to merge into `main`, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
5.  Message Ari or KJ that you have a PR that needs to be reviewed. Ari and KJ may have feedback you need to address before merging your branch into `main`.
6.  Once all feedback has been addressed, Ari or KJ will merge your branch into `main`.
