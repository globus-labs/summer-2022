      <h2>Isaac Darling</h2>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p align="justify">My name is Isaac Darling and I am a second-year undergraduate at the University of Chicago,
        majoring in computer science. My history with computer science is relatively brief, spanning only the last
        three years, but in that time I have done my best to explore the various substrata that compose the field.
        This exploration advanced my knowledge of programming languages, practices, and applications. My favorite
        language is Python, and my favorite projects so far have been my experiments with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of
        Augmenting Topologies) artificial neural networks.</p>
      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p align="justify">I have consumed a staggering amount of content relating to swaths of the technological
        landscape and I have yet to encounter something that failed to interest me. Some of my favorites, however,
        relate to: cryptography, networking, data storage/management/manipulation/visualization, and machine learning.
        I realize, only after writing that sentence, that it encompasses a sizeable chunk of the field. Additionally,
        I am currently very intrigued by the lower-level operations of computers and certain languages&mdash;mostly as
        a result of my relative unfamiliarity with the topic.</p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p align="justify">Pursuant to my interests, I want to develop a substantive body of knowledge that spans facets
        of the field that I have not personally encountered yet. I want to be able to attend talks on those topics
        with the wherewithal to comprehend the presentation and its encompassing context. I want to be able to
        confidently report my ability to write code that accomplishes tasks falling under those umbrellas. From what I
        understand, `foundry` exists in the crossroads of a number of these subsections, and I am confident that in code
        working on such a product (for lack of better terminology) I would be furthering my goals.</p>
