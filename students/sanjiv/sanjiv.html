                <h2>About Me<span class="badge bg-secondary"></span></h2>
                <p>I'm from Allentown, PA but I have also lived in New York and California. I am an incoming sophomore at the University of Michigan, majoring in computer science.
                  My first research experience began as a sophomore in high school. I partnered with a professor at Lehigh University
                    where we researched the use of computational methods to identify usable LOHCs, molecules that can enable the safe and cost effective
                     transportation of hydrogen. Additionally, I participated in the Engineering Club in 10th grade, where I worked with a team to build and program a robot 
                     to perform certain tasks and compete with other schools. Here, I developed my interest in robotics, which I am currently pursuing
                     through my project at Argonne. Outside of academics, I also like to watch/play sports, visit new places, and listen to music.</p>

                <h2>Internship Accomplishments</h2>
                <p>The Self Driving Lab Project's goal is to create a fully autonomous lab. This involves enabling several robots to 
                      receive commands from a computer remotely. I began work on the Sealer, a robot that places seals on microplates.
                    I  built a program to send each of the possible commands to the sealer. Then, I created a similar program for the peeler,
                    a robot that removes seals from microplates. This program also included the ability to interpret errors and other feedback from the 
                    peeler. I then created the ROS infrastructure for the peeler and sealer with another student. This involved programming a 
                    ROS node for the peeler, a node for a camera, and a master node, along with services and topics for them to communicate with each other. 
                    I am currently working on the Plate Stacker, a robot that stores and organizes microplates, creating a program to send commands to the robot. Additionally,
                    I also was involved in the Impactful Weather Project where I worked on cookbooks to learn how to downscale weather notebooks. I then conducted research 
                    on possible ML Algorithms that could be used for downscaling. </p>
