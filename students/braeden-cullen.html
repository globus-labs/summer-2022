                  Hi, I’m Braeden, a passionate software developer looking to grow as a developer while progressing my skillset. I’ve been programming throughout my academic years and have developed within most domains under the computer science umbrella. Specifically, I am incredibly passionate about machine learning, computational science, data analysis, and data management. Working at the intersection between the natural sciences and computer science through the application of computational techniques to biological issues is something I have recently been heavily invested in.
