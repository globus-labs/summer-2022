## Interests

I love all things computer science. Over the past three years I have consumed a staggering amount of content relating to swaths of the technological landscape and I have yet to encounter something that failed to interest me. Some of my favorites, however, relate to: cryptography, network underpinnings, data storage/management/visualization, and machine learning. I realize, only after writing that sentence, that it encompasses a sizeable chunk of the field. Additionally, I am currently very intrigued by the lower-level operations of computers and certain languages&mdash;mostly as a result of my relative unfamiliarity with the topic.

## Goals

Pursuant to my interests, I want to develop a substantive body of knowledge that spans facets of the field that I have not personally encountered yet. I want to be able to attend talks on those topics and find myself possessing the wherewithal to comprehend the presentation and its encompassing context. I want to be able to confidently report my ability to write code that accomplishes tasks falling under those umbrellas. From what I understand, `foundry` exists in the crossroads of a number of these subsections, and I am confident that in working on such a product (for lack of terminology) I would be furthering my goals.
