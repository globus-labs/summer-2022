###Interests
Hi, I’m Braeden, a software developer looking to contribute to meaningful projects while working with other passionate developers. I’ve been programming throughout my academic years and have developed within most domains under the computer science umbrella. Specifically, I am incredibly passionate about machine learning, computational science, data analysis, and data management. Working at the intersection between the natural sciences and computer science through the application of computational techniques to biological issues is something I have recently been heavily invested in. I love seeing the real-world impacts of applied computer science. 

###Goals
I hope that this internship will allow me to pursue my interests alongside a team of individuals also passionate about similar areas. I want to continue to expand my depth of knowledge in these fields through high complexity projects that have a real-world impact. I also want to have produced tangible results by the end of the internship that I can use to demonstrate my progression as a developer. I would like to challenge myself to explore outside of my comfort zone by pushing myself to work with new technologies and development cycles to maximize the contributions I make to the team.
